        <div class="answer-content">
          Our purpose is to quicken the process of finding new connections. We do not have
      a chat system and instead provide a Contact Info section where you can express
      your preferred methods of communication.

          Setting up a family profile requires only a family nickname. Any other section on the
      family profile is optional for you to fill out. Note that the Contact Info section is
      only viewable to your connections.

          Before sharing any personal information, understand that your information will be viewable

          You can hide your family profile by selecting the 'Hide Family Profile' option in the
      Visibility menu. This menu is available on the right side of your family profile header.

      a request to another family.
